
Html is done in "fist.html"

javascript in "script.js"

css in "style.css"

Synopsis:
           I have done this game on finding the syllables of a word in my mother tunge.

Tests:           
           Here when we see the html page we see a start button
           when we click on it one word comes out and we have to choose the syllable for the word.
           If yes it displays "yeah".
           else "Oops".
           And a score board is there in the side for knowing the result.
codes:
