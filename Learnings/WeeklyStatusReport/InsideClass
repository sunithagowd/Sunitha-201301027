 Learnt team work.And when we talk with frndzzz we automatically do it right.

 will be hard &&&&
 
 Week2
 I was absent.But my frnds send that we r made into groups of 4 for team project and there are some groups for technical 
 startups and all.On hearing that i felt relaxed
 
 Week3:
 
 How to design app;
 
 
 Week4:
 
 Work should be divided among the team members and equal participation from all team memebers is needed.
 Scrum and agile methods
 How to get started with I mean I gave some small chotti chotti wings to my thought.
 And I thought from now onwards if I am going to attend to the class I should come prepared and ask some doubts
 otherwise if I sit dumb that is making me to think of something else, I mean I 'm loosing my concentration.
 
 
 
 Week5:
 
 Learned so much. use cases using,user stories, and Software Requirement Specification.
 And day by day this course is seeming more intresting. 
 Over the top when we discuss the things we hv to do and organizing our ideas ,clustering the thoughtsss making me to do 
 it no matter what.
 One thing I liked most in todays class is sir said we hv to question what should we do? not how?
