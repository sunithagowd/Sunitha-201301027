Uplodad  the project proposal here



I am so intrested in Designing and fashion but to some extent.So I am trying to do an app which will be a platform where
ppl can desig there own t-shirt , I got this idea because we dint have our college t-shirt I mean we had them but we dont 
use them  because we dont like the design and cloth and material type and without any design so disgusting to see.So
I want to limit this  to  ppl like students, Professionals and Sports team where they want to design there own jerkin 
for them and wear them ocassionally.
