In this project, we are solving a major issue faced on the highways in India. Drivers get stuck in the middle
of road when their vehicles break down due to various issues.The new mobile app solves that problem, by giving 
users a way to report issues when they find out about them, and to find mechanics nearby. As an irony, auto mechanics
are unemployed due to unavailability of customers. This happens because there is no platform to provide information 
about mechanics to drivers and connect both the clients. We provide an app to connect them and secure their services 
in a business model.
